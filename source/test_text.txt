I liked robots and I still like robots.
I was fascinated by watching ASIMO, an actual humanoid robot that can walk smoothly, on TV.
Thus, I belonged to control-engineering lab to learn about robots control technology at Kyushu University.
I wanted to create automatic robots with artificial intelligence that support our work because many Japanese manufacturing companies has faced shortage of engineers.
